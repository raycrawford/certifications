# Certification Plan

## Vouchers

Currently, I have a MS Voucher 3 pack that includes 3 certification exams + 3 retakes + 3 practice tests and a $200 discount on the LFCS exam (Linux Foundations Certified Systems Admin).  The practice tests only last for 30 days.  I already blew one, but it wasn't that useful since it covered old stuff.  ***Exam vouchers expire 11/16/17.***

The current plan for Azure certifications is:

1. Get MSCA: Linux on Azure
   * 70-533; Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions
   * [LFCS](./LFCS/home.md)
2. Get MCSE: Cloud Platforms & Infrastructure
   * MCSA: Linux on Azure
   * 532 or 534; I opt for 534; Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions
3. Use 3rd voucher for 70-774; Cloud Data Science with Azure Machine Learning

Then, pick Chef back up and complete the certification "Certified Chef Developer"
1. Already passed "Basic Chef Fluency" in May 2017 at ChefConf
2. Local Cookbook Development
3. (Probably) Deploying Cookbooks

I have to use the MS vouchers by 11/16/17.  I would like to get that certification by the end of September 2017 and to complete my Chef certification by EOY 2017.

Exams:
* 532
  * Schedule at 8:30AM 8/23; used voucher *A45 - the first of the three pack and the first time I am taking it; as an FYI, I fucked up.  I should have scheduled 533.  Now I HAVE to take 532 (rather than 534) if I want a voucher left for the machine learning stuff.
